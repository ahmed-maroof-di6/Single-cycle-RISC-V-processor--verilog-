This repository contains the Verilog source code and documentation for a 32 bit single-cycle RISC-V processor designed to support I, S, R, & SB type instructions. The processor is implemented in Verilog and is intended for educational and research purposes.

## Features

- Support for I, S, R, & SB type instructions as per the RISC-V ISA.
- Single-cycle architecture for simplicity and ease of understanding.
- Clear and well-documented Verilog code for each module.
- Testbench and sample programs to demonstrate the functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, iverilog, or any other compatible tool).
- [Optional] FPGA synthesis tools if you want to implement the processor on hardware.

## Getting Started

All blocks are made as design files with test benches written in Verilog with the same name as the design file.
Run and simulate SCP_RSCV_testbench.v

Follow these steps to get the processor up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-maroof-di6/Single-cycle-RISC-V-processor-verilog/
